Description: a fast web-interface for git repositories
 cgit is
  * a cgi application implemented in C: it's basically (yet) another git
    command, used to generate html.
  * not forking: all git operations are performed by linking with libgit.a.
  * using a built-in cache: the generated html is stored on disk for the
    benefit of later requests.
  * fond of virtual urls: with the help of modules like mod_rewrite, cgit uses
    urls like http://hjemli.net/git/git/log/Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
  * not too visual, but sometimes a bit of graphics can be justified.
